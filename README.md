# Static Pages Demo
> Demo of a static site built using the Jekyll tutorial

This project is based on following the [Jekyll Step-by-Step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) and is hosted on Github Pages.

The contents of this project show how to work with Liquid and parts of Jekyll. The HTML that is applied is simple and overrides the layout which is handled by a theme, so no theme is used here. Therefore no Gemfile is needed.


## Installation

### System Dependencies

Install Jekyll

```bash
$ gem install --user-install jekyll
```


### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/static-pages-demo.git
```

## Run

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Open in the browser: http://localhost:4000/static-page-demo

All the pages are off that base page path. This is so that this project works well when running as a Github Pages Project.
